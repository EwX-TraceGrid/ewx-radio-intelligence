# EwX: Radio Signal Intelligence with AI

This repository is part of a broader research initiative aimed at developing AI-driven systems for detecting, classifying, and analyzing hostile radio emissions using drone-based sensor networks.

## Key Objectives:
- Capture and process radio signals using airborne platforms.
- Apply machine learning models to identify types of radio sources (e.g., UAV controllers, drones, jammers, communication devices).
- Develop a prototype pipeline for signal preprocessing, classification, and mapping.

## Current Status:
- Prototype project structure established.
- Signal simulation and spectrogram generation available.
- Preparation for training machine learning models is ongoing.

## Disclaimer:
This repository is under active development. Detailed documentation, datasets, and final models will be released at a later stage of the project.
